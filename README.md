# Scheduler_OS_Task

A simple python program that schedules processes according to an algorithm choosen from a set of different scheduling algorithms

Implemented Algorithms:

FCFS (first come first serve).
Non-preemptive HPF (highest Priority First).
Round robin (fixed quantum).
Preemptive SRTN (shortest remaining time next).
